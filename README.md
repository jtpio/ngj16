## Description

Hi, I'm L3-AK, the robot you sent to space with the mission of finding water, and hopefully signs of life!

What? You don't remember?
Ah never mind.

It's been a long trip, but I can finally see the planet. Almost there!

Use `/start` so we can start talking, as I will definitely need help once I land on that planet.

## Run the bot

At the time of writing, the bot is live and the game is playable directly.

But as mentioned on the entry page, this might not be the case in the future.

To run the bot or self-host it:

1. Create a Bot on Telegram. Refer to the [documentation](//core.telegram.org/bots/api) for more details
2. The program expects the environment variable `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_KRKKRK` to contain the token of your own bot
3. Use **Python 3.5+** preferably
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. That should be it!
