# L3-AK

## Description

Hi, I'm L3-AK, the robot you sent to space with the mission of finding water, and hopefully signs of life!

What? You don't remember? Ah never mind.

It's been a long trip, but I can finally see the planet. Almost there!

Use /start so we can start talking, as I will definitely need help once I land on that planet.
